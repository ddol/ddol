## Hi, I'm David 👋 but you can call me Dolphin 🐬

* 🏡 I'm an Irish engineer living in San Francisco with my wife and kids.
* ☎️ I worked at Airbnb for ten years and built their customer support hotline infrastructure using open-source software (Kamailio and FreeSWITCH).
* 🚀 One of my prior startups (PhoneSys) was part of Y Combinator's Summer 2011 batch.
* 🇮🇪🇺🇸 I'm a dual citizen of Ireland and the USA.
* 🎲 Every day, I play one or more board games with my kids.
* 🧙‍♀️ I once interviewed Terry Pratchett for my university's radio station. You can find the interview [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20120423234156/http://ian.ie/521/terry-pratchett/).
